Nasnet mobile trained on images which where resized (preserving aspect ratio) and padded to 256x256 images, then randomly cropped to 224x224.

The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) was calculated on a validation set of
10.000 images.

Padded images, center cropped to 224x224
Rho: 0.6573

Padded images, scaled down to 224x224
Rho: 0.6514

This network was then finetuned (over 5 epochs, with decreasing learning rate) on the training set where the images were resized (no padding) to 256x256, then randomly cropped to 224x224.

Resized images, center cropped to 224x224:
Rho: 0.6442

Resized images, scaled down to 224x224
Rho: 0.6481
